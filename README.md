# CNN-Model
A image Classification model on Cifar Dataset

# Introduction
There are many convolutional architectures prevailing at the current state of art which could obtain more than 90 percent accuracy in Cifar Dataset[2]. Some of them are shown in the Fig 10.
CIFAR10 is an image dataset consisting of natural color images, which is commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep neural networks for image recognition. The dataset contains 60,000 small images with dimensions of 32x32 pixels, belonging to ten different categories such as airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. The dataset is divided into two sets: a training set with 50,000 images and a test set with 10,000 images (1000 images per category) [3].
